# Play Slick Scheduler Starter

It provides APIs to get *webfetcher* results.


#### Usage

To run it, use `sbt run` command.

To get all results, send a *GET* request to [localhost:9000/data](http://http://localhost:9000/data "Get All").

To get selective results, send a *POST* request to [localhost:9000/data](http://http://localhost:9000/data "Get Selective") with following JSON data.
```json
{
    "page_url" : "your_link_here"
    "inbound_links" : your_link_count_here
}
```

#### How it works?

It reads data from json files inside `output` folder generated by *webfetcher*.
